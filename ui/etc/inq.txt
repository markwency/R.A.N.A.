want to send another SMS just to correct our announcement so what we
did instead is put your name in the Batch 4 list which would complete the
64 volunteers. (cont.)

delayed by two weeks. Upon visit to the accounting office,accordig to
them, the papers were returned to sfad because of some technical
lapses(?),just two days ago. (Or perhaps it was only returned to the acct
office two days ago) when would it be finally released?

stipend. As for the SA salary payroll, wala daw pong bumalik sa SFAD. -

payroll. Kung yung SA salary mo for February yung tinatanong mo, nasa
March payroll talaga dapat sya, na di pa narerelease as of now. Thanks! -

We are able to process this 1-2 days after submission of DTR. After that,
the documents will go through accounting, budgetary, and disbursement
process which takes a longer time. For more information about the live

salary. We are able to process this 1-2 days after submission of DTR. After
that, the documents will go through accounting, budgetary, and
disbursement process which takes a longer time. For more information
about the live status of your SA salary, text SWELDO to 29290200
(P1/text). Thanks!

30 Apr, 10:52
Student: Can I renew my STS Bracketing for this coming semester? I am
a student from Batch 2014 but I withdrew my enrollment last October
2014. Can I use it instead of applying again for tuition discount? Because
for this past week and coming weeks, only Batch 2015 students are
allowed to apply for STS for some time. The problem is that I'm from
batch 2014 (enrolling as an NF) and I couldn't apply yet. Also, my
enrollment is on May 15. There's a possibility that I'll be getting no
discount at all (Bracket A). And I couldn't afford it. That is why I'm asking
how will be the process for SLB? Thanks.

thoughts are not yet very clear. Then, just piece them together when you
write the paragraphs. Drafts don't have to be perfect so write even if the
thoughts are still poorly stated. But don't forget to revise them later!

06 Jan, 15:01 Student: Really? The promisorry note can be repeatedly extended?
06 Jan, 15:18

note requires his approval. When you get back to UPLB, we advise you to
drop by Window 3, 2/F SU Building so you can personally discuss your
situation with our staff. They have access to your loan records at Window
3 so they will be able to provide you more information about the
possibility of extending your promissory note. Thanks!
User#916 06 Jan, 15:00
Student: Good afternoon, UPLB OSA. I just wanted to inquire regarding
my situation with the SLB.
Last semester, I applied for an 80% loan during admission and I was
given three dates to make partial payments for it.
However, due to our financial circumstance, I was not able to pay any of
the partial payments during the given dates and I have still not settled
that loan until today.
We still do not have enough money today to pay for my admission this
coming 2nd Semester A.Y. 2015-2016 and I was wondering if I could still
apply for the SLB this semester even if I still have a balance to settle from
last semester? Can I write a promissory note for my previous balance so I
can apply for another loan this semester? It would be extremely helpful if
we can avail the loan again this semester.
Hoping for your favorable response,
Mackie
06 Jan, 15:03
Staff: Hello there Mackie! We advise you to indicate your situation in your
promissory note when you register this semester. This is subject for
approval of the Chancellor. Thanks!
06 Jan, 15:05 Student: Glad to hear it!
06 Jan, 15:05
Student: So when I apply for the loan this semester, I should also attach
a promissory note for my previous loan? Thank you.
06 Jan, 15:06 Student: Hehe buti ka pa UPLB OSA bumabalik
06 Jan, 15:06 Student: yung iba nang-iiwan lang
06 Jan, 15:23
Staff: In the content area of your promissory note form, just indicate your
situation why you are unable to settle your previous loan. Upon
submission of the form at SFAD, your outstanding loans will be listed by
the loan coordinator which should reflect any loans that you may have in
the previous semester. Here's a copy of the promissory note form:

promissory note is for the balance I had last semester? Once I settle my
balance last semester I can then apply for an 80% loan for my balance
next semester? Thanks.
13 Jan, 08:02
Staff: Yes. To clarify, you need the promissory note if you wish to enroll
and you still have unpaid loan balance. However, once you settle all your
loan balance, you may avail of SLB normally without having to submit a
promissory note. Thanks!

re-openings or deadlines especially the one which is/are applicable for me
for like "Agribiz Travellers Inc. Veterinary Undergraduate Scholarship
Grant, Masako & Hiromitsu Katoh Veterinary Undergrad Scholarship,
Philippine Canine Club, Inc. Scholarship Grant (PCCI), and Vicente B. Bello
Scholarship Program (VBBSP)." Unfortunately, I've had only read the
scholarships listed on the osa site lately more likely the end of the
semester so the one with available slot/s said that November 11, 2015
was its deadline. I just really wanted to know about the dates where the
said scholarships would be accepting students again. Furthermore I am
also baffled regarding the recommendation from former prof/s also and if I
it is okay to try to apply on these scholarships as many as I could for
greater chance maybe? I hope for your kind consideration and concern
regarding with this kind of matter. Thankyou!
-Elbert John Paulino
08 Jan, 12:17 Staff: The list of scholarships and available slots are updated every end of

provided by the SystemOne Development Team, it seems that the only
way to reach them is to personally drop by their office at the CEC Building.
If you are unable to drop by, you can try and ask a friend to transact for
you but remember to provide your friend your ID and authorization letter.

your supervisor. Would you like us to give you her email address? Thank
you.
11 Jan, 13:12
Staff: Since the helpdesk has limited access, we can only provide you the
email address of your supervisor. Would you like us to give you her email
address? Thank you.
11 Jan, 15:45 Student: Her mobile number.
11 Jan, 16:21

information. The email address of your supervisor is
maritescastro@gmail.com. Thanks and have a great day!
11 Jan, 16:58 Student: Can you also give me the email of ms. Sarah from IE dept
11 Jan, 16:58 Student: Thank you

Thanks!
14 Jan, 15:59

Engineering Department?
14 Jan, 15:59 Student: from the office of Mr. Haerold Layaoen

DTR was submitted on January 4.
15 Jan, 16:44 Staff: We have already received your DTR. Thank you.
30 Jan, 15:49 Student: hi good day
30 Jan, 15:49 Student: i have a question
30 Jan, 15:49 Student: what is the eligibility for student assistanship
30 Jan, 17:44
Staff: Hi Geosanna! For a student to be able to apply as SA, s/he must:
-be a UPLB student
-have finished at least one semester in the university
-enrolled in 12-21 units
Thanks!
30 Jan, 17:45 Student: what if he/she is enrolled less than 5 units?
30 Jan, 17:45 Student: He/she is still qualified correct? becasue there so much free time
30 Jan, 18:05
Staff: A student enrolled in less than 12 units may be appointed as SA if
the student is graduating during the same semester.
30 Jan, 18:06
Student: what if he/she is not yet graduating. just lacked slots because
he/she was unlucky during registration?
30 Jan, 18:08
Student: slots were exhausted in most of his subjects. but he wishes to
apply as SA because of too much free time
30 Jan, 18:26
Staff: If an SA applicant is enrolled in less than 12 units and is not yet
graduating, the student must submit a valid justification explaining his/her
situation. It must be signed by the student's faculty adviser, endorsed by
the student's college secretary, and confirmed by the student's dean. A
committee will evaluate, validate, and act on the request. If the request is
approved, the student will be allowed to apply as a student assistant.
Thanks!
30 Jan, 18:28
Student: so.. he must write a letter of justification then leave blanks for
the adviser, college sec and dean to sign?
31 Jan, 17:12
Student: good day. when will be the release of SA fees for December
2015?
31 Jan, 23:08
Staff: You may view the status of your SA salary by texting SWELDO to
29290200 (P1/text) using the mobile number registered in your OSAM
account. OSA only processes the payroll documents and it only takes two
working days to process the documents at OSA. However, the
disbursement of SA salary undergoes standard government accounting
procedures at other offices which may take a longer time. As soon as your
SA salary is deposited to your account, the OSAM System will be updated
and you may view the status through the SWELDO keyword. Thanks!
12 Feb, 15:18 Student: good day
12 Feb, 15:20 Student: I still haven't received my pay for November and December ...
12 Feb, 16:16
Staff: Hi! OSA only prepares the documents needed for the SA salary. We
are able to process this 1-2 days after submission of DTR. After that, the
documents are forwarded to the Accounting Office, Budget Management
Office, and Cashier's Office for the usual government accounting,
budgetary, and disbursement process which may take a longer time. For
more information about the live status of your SA salary, text SWELDO to
29290200 (P1/text). Thanks!

Student: Good evening :)
I wasn't able to pay my loan in full last semester. Do I just pay the
remaining balance and apply again for a loan for this semester or are
there other steps that I need to do before enrolling this semester?
I'm worried that my remaining balance would affect my enrollment this
semester.
Thank you for your patience.
09 Jan, 22:07
Staff: Good evening Charlene! We advise you to pay your balance as soon
as possible because the interest is computed daily and we have observed
that lines are getting longer towards the end of the registration period.
So, we believe that transacting early would mean shorter waiting time! To
pay your SLB loan, just proceed to Window 3 and present your Form 5 for
last semester. Have a great weekend!
09 Jan, 22:09 Student: Thank you :)

Student: Good day! I am Angelica Cassandra M. Loria an undergraduate of
the BS Math program. I am a student assistant since 2012, and for this
coming 2nd sem I think I cannot apply as an SA since I have a warning
scholastic standing in the previous sem. I believe that the only students
who can apply are those with good scholastic standing. Do you consider
some cases im which a student can still qualify being a student assistant?
10 Jan, 01:06 Staff: Hello there AC! Great news! You may apply as a student assistant
this coming semester provided you enroll at least 12 units. There is no
more grade requirement for the SA program effective First Semester, AY
2015-2016. We do, however, encourage students to ensure that their
work as an SA will not interfere in any way with their academics. Have a
great night!

Student: Good morning po. May concern lang po ako tungkol sa student
assistantship. I'm a fourth year student, batch 2012 and gusto ko po
sanang ituloy ang pagiging student assistant last sem, kaso po I read the
office's rule na dapat at least 12 units ang student para maging S.A.,
unless the student has a graduating status. I have only 9 units for this
incoming semester, I'm delayed for graduation but good po ang standing
ko po for the last semesters. Makakapag-S.A. pa po ba ako? Thank you
po.
10 Jan, 22:18
Staff: Hey Carl! What is the reason why you will not be able to enroll 12
units? Thanks!
11 Jan, 00:05
Student: Ang available ko lang po na makukuhang subjects ay worth 9
units lang po (3 subjects) over 13 maximum units this semester. Naging
result po yan ng nagdrop po ako ng isang seasonal subject nung 2nd year
student po ako and nagfollow na po ang pagiging delayed student ko po
sa BS MST curriculum.
11 Jan, 00:39
Staff: Hi Carl! If you will be enrolled in less than 12 units and you are not
yet graduating, you need to submit a valid justification explaining your
situation. It must be signed by your faculty adviser, endorsed by your
college secretary, and confirmed by your dean. A committee will evaluate,
validate, and act on your request. If your request is approved, you will be
allowed to apply as a student assistant.
11 Jan, 00:42
Staff: We advise you to work on this as soon as possible to avoid the
second semester registration "rush" especially because you will need your
adviser, college secretary, and dean to sign your request. We hope you
can avail of the SA program this semester. Thanks and have a great
morning!

Staff: [Staff Comment]: @everyone for your info - this is the policy as per
the SAGA CRR. I am not sure why the Dean must sign the request. This
seems totally unnecessary and could probably be just a mistake but this is
the rule as per the CRR signed by PAEP. Please ask the SA section if they
are aware of this. It's in item 16 letter B of the CRR:

niyo?
26 Jan, 10:59
Staff: Hi Evian! We would just like to clarify. If you were already able to
pay for your SLB loan, then you do not have any more debt. There are
cases wherein students where issued by the colleges their Form 5s
inadvertently even if they still have SLB accountabilities. We just want to
make sure that this does not happen to you because interest charges are
computed daily. If you are unsure, you can have this verified at Window 3,
2/F SU Building. Thanks and have a great day!

far from the University and can't be accompanied by their parents/codebtor
during their SLB Application. If your co-debtor can accompany you,
you don't need to use co-debtor certification. Regarding the process, you
with your co-debtor must bring your Form5, your SLB Form, and your codebtor's
valid ID to Window 3, 2/F, SU Building. Thanks!

Staff: Hi Josel! Since DOST scholarships are handled by the Office of the
University Registrar, we advise you to discuss this with the OUR. Thanks!
27 Jan, 20:30
Staff: [Staff Comment]: @channel can you ask the SLB section if this
student can just avail of the 100% SLB loan while waiting for the
endorsement letter from DOST? I'm thinking that as soon as OUR receives
this much-awaited document, the student can request for SLB loan
cancellation. If the SLB section says that this is allowed, kindly advise this
student of this option. Also ask if it would be the student's responsibility to
coordinate this or will OUR and SFAD coordinate directly so we can advise
the student to periodically follow this up with OUR. Thanks!

Student: Hello po! Prof. Mark here. I need help with the SA Allocated
number of hours. We were only given 80 hours po compared to 120 hours
last sem. Mas needed po sana more SA this sem. Paano po kaya yun?
13 Jan, 09:18 Student: salamat po! kahit maibalik lang yun 120 na allocation ok na po
kami
13 Jan, 10:35

the letter to:
NINA M. CADIZ

you can use the co-debtor certification form. You can download the form
and send it to your co-debtor via email so they can print and fill up the
form. Then, they can send it back to you through LBC or other carriers
with their valid id. Thanks!
13 Jan, 19:39

Para po sana maprocess na po yung sa enrollment ko. Kasi medyo
matagal pong magdeliver ang LBC. Dati naman na po kaming nagloan at

na yun as soon as dumating na po :(

Maari ding ikaw, provided na nakaenvelop ito at may authorization letter

09 Feb, 22:38
Staff: [Staff Comment]: @channel please confirm with SFAD-SA section
(please ensure that they have the approval of their head too) if we can
now allow students to submit their DTRs on their own. previously, offices
(through their messengers) must submit the DTRs to make it really hard
for anyone to tamper the DTRs. since we are now going to email
supervisors every month informing them about the DTRs we receive,
maybe we can allow SAs to submit the DTRs without passing through the
messenger?
10 Feb, 09:47
Staff: [Staff Comment]: @channel Yes, as of Kuya JP, SAs can submit
their DTR personally but it must be in a sealed envelop and with signature
of the supervisor or its authorization letter.
10 Feb, 11:19
Student: Sila pa rin po ba ang magbibigay sa inyo? Thanks po and
pasensya na po
10 Feb, 13:15
Student: Sila po ba ang magbibigay ng dtr kasama yung letter? Thanks
po!
10 Feb, 13:19

messenger. Or maaari ding ikaw personally ang magpasa nito sa SA
Section given na may aouthorization letter ka from your supervisor with
his signature and nakalagay ito sa sealed envelop. Thanks!

hindi po naprocess last year. Thanks po in advance! ฀
15 Jan, 09:14
Staff: Hi Kate! As soon as you get your refund from last year, you can use
this to pay for your matriculation fees. You may also want to avail of the
Student Loan Board (SLB) program so that you can register early even if
you still haven't received your tuition refund. If you avail of SLB, you may
pay the loan as soon as you receive your tuition refund. The interest
charges for tuition loans are waived if they are paid within four (4)
months.

familiar with your benefits as a DOST scholar. If your scholarship covers
your full matriculation fees, you need not pay any amount. However, if
your scholarship still requires you to pay a portion of your matriculation
fees, you may apply for the Student Loan Board. Thanks!

Good morning!
I already talked to a professor that I am applying as a student assistant,
and she agreed. I would just like to ask if there is a SA orientation for this
2nd semester AY 2015-2016. If there is, what time and where.
I hope that this will not be ignored. I hope for a response.
Thank you.
15 Jan, 11:39 Student: Okay, I'll wait. Thanks!
15 Jan, 11:59
Staff: Attendance to the SA orientation is no longer required as of First
Semester, AY 2015-2016. If you already have the SA item code from your

She gave the same code. What should I do now?
21 Jan, 21:33 Student: Okay, I'll wait for your response. Thanks!
22 Jan, 07:02
Staff: Hi Reinier! Kindly provide us the item code so we can verify.
Thanks!
22 Jan, 07:06 Staff: [Staff Comment]: @channel SA item codes must start with the
letter A, B, or C. A is for 1st sem. B is for 2nd sem. C is for Midyear Term.
The two digits that follow the letter is the academic year. For example: 1st
Sem, AY 2015-2016 (A15xxxxxx). 2nd sem, AY 2015-2016 (B15xxxxxx).
Midyear Term, AY 2015-2016 (C15xxxxxx). If this student provides an
item code beginning with 4 numbers, the supervisor may have provided
the student an approval code instead of an item code. Just ask the
student to tell his/her supervisor that the code s/he provided is an
approval code and not an item code. Supervisor should visit
uplbosa.org/page-howtohire.

User#1036 17 Jan, 00:00 Student: how to process the clearance. thank you
17 Jan, 20:27
Staff: Hi Ken! There are two types of clearance OSA processes. The
university clearance is for graduating or transferring students while the
registration clearance is for students who availed loans and were not able
to pay on time. Which clearance do you need assistance with? Thanks!
17 Jan, 20:29
Student: i would like to know about the the university clearanc is for
graduating
17 Jan, 20:44 Staff: Do you already have an OSAM or SystemOne account?
18 Jan, 08:12 Student: yes
18 Jan, 08:12 Student: I have a SystemOne account
18 Jan, 09:07
Staff: You can download the University Clearance from www.uplbosa.org.
First, login the site using your SystemOne username and password (since
you have SystemOne account). Second, update your profile. Then, you
can find the University Clearance by clicking Student Menu > University
Clearance. Generate it and print. Thanks!

Student: Magandang araw po! Napansin ko po sa pag generate po ng SLB
application na wala na ung option kung ilang payments po ang pwede.
Then, pagka generate ko po ay 1 payment lang po ung naka-indicate ( 20
May 2016) sa form. Pwede pa rin po bang unit-untiin ung bayad, kagaya
ng dati (2-3 payments) at hindi po isa lang sa due date?
17 Jan, 20:31
Staff: To simplify the SLB application process, there is now only one
payment deadline for SLB starting Second Semester, AY 2015-2016.
However, students may pay any time throughout the semester. To make a
partial payment during the middle of the semester, just proceed to
Window 3, 2/F SU Building. Thanks!
18 Jan, 07:29 Student: That's good to know...Thank you! ฀

What else should I do? Thank you!

Student: Good evening. I want to ask about the SLB application form and
co-debtor application form. I've been trying to generate it for days and
when I click the button to do so, I am sent to the legacy site with a blank
page. I was told to update my profile and I did but when it was time to
send the confirmation message, it always says that I must type it correctly
even though I did.
17 Jan, 18:28 Student: Thanks.
17 Jan, 20:41
Staff: Hi Mariel! That seems frustrating. Could it be possible that there is a
missing space or letter when you were typing the confirmation message?
Our system will return an error if the user does not enter the confirmation
message exactly. If you are coming to UPLB tomorrow, we advise you to
create the forms at the IT Hub, Room 7, 2/F SU Building. Our technical
staff can assist you in filling out your profile. Have a great night!

Student: Good evening, I saw your recent advertisement and would like to
inquire about your Student Assistant Writer positions. For the three
articles, do they have to be published in a website or in any other
publication or will an article written tonight suffice? Is there supposed to
be a specific topic? And how many sentences per article? Is there also a
deadline for the applications? Thank you very much!
17 Jan, 22:14 Student: Alright, thank you very much!
17 Jan, 23:02
Staff: Hi Carlos! We're not very strict with this requirement. We just ask
applicants to submit articles so we can assess their writing skills. There is
no definite topic or article length. Our search will end on 29 January 2016
but applications are reviewed as they are received so positions may be
filled up earlier than the deadline. Thanks and have a great night!

on SLB application form are allowed to be your co-debtor. Thanks!

Student: Hi! Sorry for asking again. My permanent residence is in Davao
City. Does it mean that I still need to get and present my relative's valid
ID for SLB application? Would an e-mailed scanned ID suffice or not?
20 Jan, 10:18
Staff: Good morning Angelo! Yes, you still need to present your codebtor's
valid ID. The SLB Section does not accept Scanned ID. Thanks!

Student: Hi! I have a couple of questions more. I only have one ID
(SSS/Unified Multipurpose-ID) of my mother and she's from Davao City,
will this be enough, or do I really need to ask her and send another ID?
(I'm afraid the time's running out) Another thing. We don't have the same
surnames since she and my father was not married, would that be okay?
She's using her maiden name. Thank you.
26 Jan, 16:51 Student: Ok. Thanks!
26 Jan, 17:37
Staff: Hi Angelo. SSS ID is a valid ID accepted by the SLB section. Would
you be able to provide documents that can prove that you are the son of
your mother? Or do you have your own ID with your full middle name
indicated in it? We advise you to bring any supporting document so that
when the SLB section staff asks you about it, you can show them a
supporting document. Otherwise, you may need to be interviewed by our
staff to confirm these details. In any case, just proceed to Window 3
preferably with your supporting documents. Thanks!
26 Jan, 17:51
Student: I hope a copy of my birth certificate is enough. Thank you very
much!
26 Jan, 17:55

tomorrow because lines are usually shorter during our opening time.

User#1057 19 Jan, 18:05 Student: ATTENTION: FERDIE
19 Jan, 18:05
Student: Dear Ferdie,
Last semester, I was allocated 120 hours for LITE, how come this
semester I was only given 60 hours?
If I recall, although I was granted 120 hours last sem, I only was able to
use 60 because of the data/material concerns of the SA applicant. What I
did to cope up with the many foreign trainees from August to Dec 2015
was to use my large class SA, though difficult because some large classes'
data processing was delayed because of my SAs' multitasking.
I had one SA applicant last sem who eventually withdrew (her application)
because of, according to her, the need to open a Landbank Account which
required 500 pesos deposit. In addition, she couldn't find her official UPLB
ID which is needed for her to open an account at Landbank, she couldn't
request for a new ID because she lost her form 5, and many other
problems. She made us wait for all these documents to be processed until,
before we knew it, OSA's deadline to process the application was over. We
wanted to help her earn, hence, we waited for her availability.
Since the LITE Program is a program offering English training to foreigners
(Japanese, Koreans, Thais, etc) and since it only has one fulltime
staff/NGW, how do we go about requesting for more hour allocations (may
be for next semester since the sem has begun and our new trainees are
due to arrive by May or June 2016, anyway)

Staff: [Staff Comment]: @reggie please send this during office hours.
please send a copy of this communication to fcocampo with CC to
jpvmalveda and mvasantos. just tell him that prof. dizon sent us this
inquiry and that the following message is our reply. thanks!
Dear Prof. Dizon,
Thanks for contacting the OSA Helpdesk!
We understand how frustrating this can be especially because it seemed
like your office was penalized because of the fault of your SA applicant.
Please allow us to address your concerns.
#1. The allocated hours (AH) for all UPLB units was adjusted by the UPLB
Committee on Scholarships and Financial Assistance (CSFA) based on the
utilization of SA slots. We advise you to request for an increase in your AH
by writing a letter to the OSA Director explaining the need for additional
AH. Please address the letter to:
NINA M. CADIZ
Director, Office of Student Affairs
Please remember to include your 4-digit unit ID in your letter. Requests
for additional AH will be reviewed by the CSFA.
#2. Since SA appointments contain a specific office/unit assignment and
list of duties, the SA work assignments shall be limited only to the
office/unit and list of duties in the appointments of the SAs. Thus, we
advise you to request for an increase in the budget allotted to you by OSA
at the LITE program.
#3. Since OSA understands that P500 may be too much for some
students, UPLB OSA has partnered with Landbank last year to offer bank
accounts with a maintaining balance of just P100. Landbank just requires
them to present their Form 5 and UPLB ID when they open their bank
accounts.
The OSA Helpdesk will be sending a copy of this communication to Mr.
Ferdie Ocampo. If you wish to get in touch with him directly, you may
reach him at (049) 536-3209.
If you need any more assistance regarding OSA services, please do not
hesitate to send us a message.
Thank you and have a great day!

#1. The allocated hours (AH) for all UPLB units was adjusted by the UPLB
Committee on Scholarships and Financial Assistance (CSFA) based on the
utilization of SA slots. We advise you to request for an in

the need for additional AH. Please address the letter to:
NINA M. CADIZ
Director, Office of Student Affairs
Please remember to include your 4-digit unit ID in your letter. Requests
for additional AH will be reviewed by the CSFA.
#2. Since SA appointments contain a specific office/unit assignment and
list of duties, the SA work assignments shall be limited only to the

Staff: and list of duties in the appointments of the SAs. Thus, we advise
you to request for an increase in the budget allotted to you by OSA at the
LITE program.
#3. Since OSA understands that P500 may be too much for some
students, UPLB OSA has partnered with Landbank last year to offer bank
accounts with a maintaining balance of just P100. Landbank just requires
them to present their Form 5 and UPLB ID when they open their bank
accounts.

Staff: [Staff Comment]: @charlotte Please draft a reply for this. Clarify
with SFAD which is the best time for them to send a letter because they
intend to hire towards the end of the semester. I think we will follow the
same process during the midyear term so May might be a good time to
send the request but remember to clarify with SFAD. Remind her also that
SA appointments must be coterminous with the semester or midyear term
so she can hire the SAs for June-July and August-December. Please
address her inquiry and acknowledge her story that we will discuss this to
prevent cases like this from happening again. We also need to improve
our information dissemination initiatives regarding LBP accounts. Let's
include some FAQs there too like what to do if their Form 5 or ID is
missing.
25 Jan, 10:09
Staff: [Staff Comment]: @reggie can you ask SFAD when is the best time
for Prof. Dizon to send the letter if she needs the SAs on June?
25 Jan, 13:03 Staff: [Staff Comment]: @miguel april daw po sir.
25 Jan, 13:24
Staff: Dear Prof. Dizon,
Thank you for your message. You may send the letter on or before April
2016. As per SFAD, the CSFA will review the SA allocation around that
time for Midyear 2016. There has been some changes regarding this
process as of this morning. Letters requesting for additional AH must now
be addressed to:
PORTIA G. LAPITAN
Chair, Committee on Scholarships and Financial Assistance and
Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs
Since the LITE international projects span two terms, please be advised
that appointments of SAs must be coterminous with the semester or
midyear term. Thus, their appointments will be June-July and August-
December.
Thank you for sharing your experience with your SA applicant. What your
applicant did was unpleasant and frustrating. We will discuss this at OSA
and see how we can prevent cases like this from happening again. We will
be reviewing our information dissemination initiatives and will incorporate
procedures for availing a Landbank account.
If you appreciate our service, please let us know at

21 Jan, 11:53
Staff: Good morning Prof. Danila!
We tried answering the quiz displayed by our system. However, we cannot
replicate the issue you are experiencing - we are always getting the
expected response from the system. There was also no recent change in
our system that could have affected the SA quiz. Our system logs also
show that there are at least three other employees who were able to
complete the quiz in the past hour.
After clicking the submit button, you should be prompted by a
confirmation dialog box saying "Are you sure?" After confirming, you
should be prompted with either a red box or a green box on top saying
something like:
[red box]: Your answer in question #X is wrong. Please review your
answer.
[green box]: Congratulations! You passed the quiz. The SA item codes are
displayed below.
It is possible that the page did not completely load or that the problem is
caused by the intermittent Internet connection of the University.
Would it be okay if you try to reload the page and try to answer the form
again?
If you still experience the same problem, we advise you to use the 'Report
Problem' feature at the lower right of the website. This feature allows us
to see a screen shot of the site from your perspective.
Thank you!

Student: my Name is Falk Schrewe and I'm a Student of forest science at
the Technical University of Dresden, Germany. I stayed from 02/2013
until 02/2014 in the Philipines and made a social year, for exampel i
worked with Gawad Kalinga. I came back last Holy Week to visit my host
family again. I had the idea to study my 5th Semester in the Philippines
and make my 6 weeks internship. I went to UP Los Baños that time and
talked with the office. Unfortunately, our University has no relationship
with uplb, which is why I try to get a course outline, so our examination
board can tell me if your Moduls are comparable with ours.
Is there anything else I would need for an exchange Semester? I have
problems to get in touch with the offices, i neverget any reply. is that
normal?

nalang po ba sya bayaran para maclear po ako sa OSA? Salamat po.
Pasensya na po aa abala.
26 Jan, 10:45
Staff: Hi Wchl! We cannot guarantee that you will be allowed to register
late because only the Chancellor can extend the registration period and
you need the permission of the University Registrar if you would like to
register later than the last day of late registration. What you can do is
write a letter in advance to the OUR explaining your situation so that you
can request that you be allowed to register late since the Cashier's Office
is still looking for the copy of your receipt. Only upon the approval of your
letter will you be assured that you will be able to register late. We think
that it is unlikely that there are no records of your payment in the
Cashier's Office. We are hoping that they will be able to trace your
payment after the registration "rush" so you can be cleared of your
deficiency. Thanks!

I have recently claimed the alloted hours for my SA and have already
entered the code. However, I will be transferring to DevCom soon.
In this light, I would like to ask if there's a process that would allow me to
transfer my allotted hours to one of my officemates?
Thank you very much.
25 Jan, 14:46
Staff: Hi Joseph! You can use the 'Share AH' feature in the SA Portal. Just
log in to www.uplbosa.org/hire, click Share AH, then provide the email

we will have to reset the application form of the applicant. The process
isn't exactly seamless but it is possible to transfer the AH to another staff

application form but it says that I already have generated an app'n form
for this semester. How can I generate another form for SUPSA?
31 Jan, 23:09
Staff: Hi Arianne! Just drop by Window 1, 2/F SU Building during office
hours. Please remember to bring a copy of the SA application form you
generated and your UPLB ID. The SA section will be able to reset your SA
application so you can use the item code provided to you by the
Department of Human Kinetics. Thanks!
31 Jan, 23:12
Student: Good evening. Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of the
application form I generated as I submitted it immediately after having it
signed. Is it alright if I just bring my ID?
31 Jan, 23:27
Staff: When you log in to your OSAM account and you try to generate
another SA application form, the page should tell you that you already
generated an application form along with the link that says Download SA
Application Form (SFAD Form 3B). This is the link to download your old
application form. Please download the form and copy the code that starts
with "AFSA." Kindly provide the code (just write it on a piece of paper)
and your UPLB ID to our SA section staff at Window 1. Thanks!

receive an SMS from OSA saying that your appointment was already
processed?
31 Jan, 23:43 Student: Yes. I already received it.
31 Jan, 23:45
Student: However, I was notified only recently, after my appointment was
processed, that I am also the recipient of the varsity scholarship (SUPSA).
How can process it or will I still be able to process it?
31 Jan, 23:49
Staff: Since your appointment was already processed, your application can
no longer be reset. Instead, you need to resign first from your current
work. Kindly fill out the resignation form and have it signed by your
current supervisor. The form can be downloaded from
https://www.uplbosa.org/download/saseparation.
If you rendered service during your appointment until 29 Jan 2016, we
advise you to generate your DTR before filing your resignation.
Please submit the resignation form (and your January 2016 DTR) to
Window 1, 2/F SU Building. After your resignation is processed by the SA
section, you will be able to generate another form for your varsity
scholarship.

04 Feb, 15:11
Staff: Hi Arianne! Since we are still using the Legacy OSAM System, we
have a system limitation that students are not allowed to report from AM
to PM without any break. Thus, in order to input this record, you need to
put 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and 12:01 PM to 1:00 PM. Since students
usually leave the offices before their classes (e.g. 12:53 PM), we advise
the students to make the adjustment by adding one minute after they
leave. Instead of writing 12:00 PM to 12:53 PM, students can put 12:01
PM to 12:54 PM. Thank you.
04 Feb, 15:30 Student: Oh okay. Noted. Thank you!

Student: Good day. Yung concern ko po is about my Student Assistanship.
Kasi po nung nagtingin po ako sa bangko bigla pong account invalid yun
lumalabas sa account ko. Hindi ko po alam kung yung sweldo ko last sem
ay dun padin pinapadala ng OSA. Is it possible po na makuha ko pa yung
mga sweldo ko - Jeuel B. Adefuin 2012-37531
01 Feb, 11:10
Staff: Hi Jeuel! Please coordinate with the SA section regarding this at
Window 1, 2/F SU Building. Based on our records, your salary for October
2015 was deposited to your Landbank account. However, if your account
is no longer active, your salary may still be at the Cashier's Office. We
advise you to coordinate with the SA section as soon as possible. Thanks!

01 Feb, 17:10 Student: Can I still use the codebtor form?
01 Feb, 18:34
Staff: Sure! However, please be advised that the Co-debtor Certification
Form is designed for students who still do not have their Form 5s/26s.
Ideally, this is for students who live in places far from the university.
While they are still in their respective provinces before the registration
period, they can already ask their parents to sign. If you already have
your Form 5 and 26, it is better to use the SLB application form. For more
information, please refer to
https://www.facebook.com/uplbosa/posts/914587315257903. Thanks!
01 Feb, 21:49
Student: Yun na po kasi yung naapermahan ko na at dala ko dito sa elbi
ngayon eh. Baka po hindi din ko umabot kapag umuwi pa ko ulit sa
province. Nasakin na din po kasi yung form 5 ko.
01 Feb, 23:10
Staff: No problem! As long as your co-debtor certification form is signed
by your co-debtor and confirmed by the presence of a valid ID of your codebtor,
you will be allowed to avail the loan. Thanks!
User#1137 01 Feb, 15:44 Student: Kailan po magiging available yung cash loan?

Item Codes' link. After canceling an item code, the AH will be returned to
you so you can create a new item code. But this will only work if you still
do not have an applicant who has already generated an application form.
Please let us know if you were able to cancel an existing item code and
create a new item code. Thanks!

loan sa SLB? Thank you po in advance ☺
04 Feb, 15:42
Staff: Good day! Maari kang magprocess ng request for late registration.
And since nasa Dean's Office pa ang promissory note mo, subukan mong
itanong sa kanila kung payag ba silang dagdagan mo nalang yung
promisorry note mo ng request mo for late registration dun sa "Content of
Request" para hindi ka na magdoble ng process. Kung hindi naman sila
pumayag, kailangan mong kumuha ng Request Form for late registration
sa Window 3, 2/F, SU Building. Thanks!
04 Feb, 19:04
Student: Ah okay po. Gaano po kaya katagal ang pag-process nun?
Aabutin po ba ng ilang araw? And pwede po ba ako mag-apply ng 100%
slb loan? Thanks po :)
05 Feb, 08:44
Staff: Hi Ffyona! The time of processing the promissory note depends on
how you process your documents. Regarding 100% SLB, since you
process your promissory note, we assume that you have your unpaid loan
so you are not allowed to request for 100% SLB. Thanks!

Student: Good day po ulit! I am facing a big problem po kasi ngayon. And
wala na po akong ibang makausap tungkol dito. Nag-dorm po kasi ako last
sem outside UP and ngayon po lumipat ako ng UP dorm. May naiwan po
akong unsettled accounts sa dati kong dorm at hanggang ngayon ay hindi
ko pa po kayang bayaran. Nakiusap po ako sa landlord ko na bigyan ako
ng isang buwan para mabayaran iyon lahat. Pero ayaw po nilang pumayag
at paulit-ulit po ang pananakot nila na hahalungkatin lahat ng records ko
sa university at ipapa-police daw po ako. Ano po kaya ang pwedeng
mangyari kung sakaling makipag-ugnayan sila sa inyong tanggapan
tungkol dito? Sa katunayan po ay natatakot na rin ako sa mga pagbabanta
nila. Maraming salamat po.

Hi Ffyona! Thank you for contacting the OSA Helpdesk. When third parties
coordinate with our office, their requests are addressed on a case by case
basis. Thus, there is no standard protocol for these types of requests. We
apologize because we have limited access at the OSA Helpdesk. We advise
you to coordinate with the barangay office regarding this. It is usual
practice for the police to hand over matters like this to the barangay.
Thank you.

Student: We are from #275 Enactus UP Los Banos and we would like to
request to have our recognition update forms regenerated because there
were technical errors experience while generating the forms. It was not in
my mind and it was not informed that we would need the signatures of
the formerly elected officers and we have not yet updated the
membership roster when we generated the form and thus, the
confirmation and verification was entered without prejudice. We would be
admitting new officers this coming week through invitations so new
officers would probably be appointed.
To hereby correct it, I owe up to my mistakes and request for correction
of the said forms.
Thank you very much!

transaction of the org thus, should not sign. I was not able to check it
prior to generating the form because I thought it would not matter.

Student: Good evening, I would just like to get some updates regarding
the salary of SAs for the month of December. Thank you.
09 Feb, 21:03
Staff: Hi Alexie! OSA only prepares the documents needed for the SA
salary. We are able to process this 1-2 days after submission of DTR. After
that, the documents will go through accounting, budgetary, and
disbursement process which takes a longer time. For more information
about the live status of your SA salary, text SWELDO to 29290200
(P1/text). Thanks!
09 Feb, 21:08
Student: Okay, but upon checking in the uplbosa.org/legacy website, the
status of my DTR is only marked as "Generated". When will it be marked
"Received"?
09 Feb, 22:33
Staff: Hi Alexie! This means that we still haven't received your DTR. It is
possible that the office you are working for has not yet forwarded the
documents to our office. We advise you to coordinate with your supervisor
regarding this. Thanks!
10 Feb, 06:21

anyway, I'll just wait and check again this week. Thank you.
10 Feb, 09:22
Staff: Just to clarify, did you submit your DTR on or before the submission
deadline, 5 February 2016? Thank you.
10 Feb, 09:33 Student: Yes. it was way earlier around the third week of January.
10 Feb, 13:24
Staff: Are you referring to a late DTR? DTRs submitted late are processed
after processing the DTRs submitted on time. December 2015 DTRs were
processed starting on the deadline, 15 Jan 2016. January 2016 DTRs were
processed starting 5 Feb 2016.

User#1197 19 Feb, 16:52
Student: Good afternoon. I'm Jemimah Michelle Tamor and I graduated
from UPLB last July 2015 under BA Sociology. My concern is that I have
hastly migrated to Singapore and was not able to do my clearance so I
asked some of my friends back in the university to help me with it. But to
process the university clearance I have to answer a questionnaire from
the Office of Student Affairs wedsite. My problem is that I cannot access
the website using both my systemone account (because it says that it's
offline) and osam account and I also cannot ask for a temporary account
because the phone number still registered in my s1 account is that of my
Philippine number which is already not in use since I am already here in
Singapore. I would wish to have a bit of advice on how to proceed with
the situation. Would it be possible to have a copy of the data sheet that I
have to fill out without logging into the osa website?
Thank you in advance for your response!
19 Feb, 22:31
Staff: Hi Jemimah! We can grant you access to your account. However, we
would need you to verify your identity first since you are using a Facebook
account. Kindly provide us the following information:
1. What is your mother's maiden name?
2. What is the mobile number registered in your OSAM account?
3. Where were you born?
Thank you.

enroll a Landbank account under your name. Thanks!

papers?
